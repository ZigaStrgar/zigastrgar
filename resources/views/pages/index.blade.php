            Backend-oriented engineer focused on delivering highly performant and scalable solutions in Node.JS and Laravel.

        While the previous statement is correct, I would like for you to know more than
        just the professional side of me. While my biggest passions include developing backend systems and solving problems.
        Underneath all of that I'm a regular man finding his relaxation in reading all kinds of books (usually non-fiction ones),
        tasting diffrent kinds of wines from all over the world, occasionally indulging in TV shows and of course last
        but not least hanging out with my family, friends and lately my team-mates.

        While my "professional" carrer started with developing websites all the way back in 2010 or 2011. At the time
        I was still in the elementary school. Those pages weren't cool & pretty, but I've managed to get some knowledge
        to make websites. And all that excitment led me to go to primary school for Computer Technitians, where
        I've been introduced with C++ at first, and later on with PHP.
    </p>
    <p class="article-content mt20">
        I liked PHP and that's why I started with digging into PHP and SQL. Started working
        on web pages for my friends, for me, my mom's company, etc. In 2 years I learned pretty much everything to make
        a high quality web page not vulnerable to SQL Injection, XSS and simillar attacks. My last project with plan PHP,
        MySQL, without any frameworks or simillar was my graduation project, website for selling used car parts from
        junkyards and mechanics.

    <p class="article-content mt20">
        In late 2015 I discovered the PHP framework <a href="https://laravel.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Laravel</a>
        at first I couldn't wrap my head around it but once I found <a href="https://laracasts.com" rel="noreferrer noopener"
                                                                       target="_blank">Laracasts</a> it was like poetry.
        Instantly enjoyed the development process and the whole structure how Laravel is built, booted and what kind of
        features it provides "out of the box". Also I've attended first LaraCon Online 2017 on March 8<sup>th</sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="article-content mt20">
        During my faculty years I've used Python, Java, C, C#, and R. While in my free-time in those 3 years, I've also did some
        developing with Swift. Python was used as part of the first programming language in the 1<sup>st</sup> year and
        in the last year I've used Python and R for Data Mining projects and Decision & Recommender Systems curriculum.
    </p>
    <p class="article-content mt20">
        Recently my carrer is covered with Node.JS development, and at the moment I enjoyed it much more than Laravel.
        It's different but, a nice way of different. The world is a bit different with NoSQL databases and Fastify framework.
    </p>
    <p class="article-content mt20">
        And my perosnal life is filled with learning French. Oui, Française. Out of all languages.
        It's my passion to learn French and someday live for a bit on the southern beaches of France.
        Last but not least, it's filled with paying Flag Football as a defensive back at
        <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ljubljanafrogs.si/teams/ljubljana-frogs/players/ziga-strgar-25">Ljubljana Frogs</a>, which is also a club I co-founded in May 2020.
