    <h1 class="page-header text-center">So who am I?</h1>
    <p class="text-center h3"><strong>I am Å½iga Strgar. Student at faculty of computer science and informatics in
            Ljubljana, Slovenia.</strong></p>
    <p class="article-content mt20">Yeah well that statement above is <b>100%</b> correct but I think I'm so much more
        than <i>"just"</i> that. Yes my passion is web development and solving problems but underneath all of that I'm a
        regular boy finding his relaxation in reading all kinds of books (usually non-fiction ones), TV shows and of
        course last but not least hanging out with my friends.</p>
    <p class="article-content mt20">Web development, huuh? Started with it back in 2010 or 2011. While I was still in
        elementary school. Those websites weren't so cool & pretty but I got into it. They contained only HTML and CSS.
        And I was using NVU. Which means I didn't even bother with how the page was looking underneath all that visual
        representation inside the program.</p>
    <p class="article-content mt20">And then here it is. Secondary school, project week and a course where I got
        introduced to PHP and MySQL. I liked it and that's why I started with digging into PHP and SQL. Started working
        on web pages for my friends, for me, my mom's company, etc. In 2 years I learned pretty much everything to make
        a high quality web page not vulnerable to SQL Injection, XSS. At some point I wanted to re-create a CMS like
        Wordpress but I quit when project was like 25% done :(</p>
    <p class="article-content mt20">In late 2015 I discovered the PHP framework <a href="https://laravel.com"
                                                                                   rel="noreferrer noopener"
                                                                                   target="_blank">Laravel</a> at first
        I couldn't wrap my head around it but once I found <a href="https://laracasts.com" rel="noreferrer noopener"
                                                              target="_blank">Laracasts</a> it was like poetry.
        Instantly enjoyed the development process and the whole structure how Laravel is built, booted and what kind of
        features it provides "out of the box". Also I've attended first LaraCon Online 2017 on March 8<sup>th</sup>.

    <p class="article-content mt20">
        Beside web development I'm also diving into the world of mobile development and desktop languages. In the mobile
        world I'm working with Swift, for development of iOS applications. So far I just stayed with "playground"
        application, nothing is published on AppStore so far. As desktop languages I'm referring to Java and C#, C# is
        still from my high school years, but Java is more of a recent thing as we do all the assignments for faculty in
        it. Lately I'm getting my hands dirty with Python in the world of Data Mining as part of the faculty curriculum.

    <p class="article-content mt20">
        On my programming bucket list are still this languages: SmallTalk, Go, Ruby on Rails.
